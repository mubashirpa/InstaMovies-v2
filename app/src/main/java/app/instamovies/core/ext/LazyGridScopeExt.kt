 * for multiple items in the grid is not allowed. Type of the key should be savable
 * via Bundle on Android. If null is passed the position in the grid will represent the key.
 * When you specify the key the scroll position will be maintained based on the key, which
 * means if you add/remove items before the current visible item the item with the given key
 * will be kept as the first visible one.
 * @param contentType the type of the content of this item. The item compositions of the same
 * type could be reused more efficiently. Note that null is a valid type and items of such
 * type will be considered compatible.
 * @param content the content of the item
