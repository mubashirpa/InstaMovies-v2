# Insta Movies

Millions of movies, TV shows and people to discover. Explore now.

Welcome to Insta Movies! This app allows you to browse movies and TV shows using data from The Movie Database (TMDb). It's packed with features and built with the latest technologies. 

## Features
- **Multiple Screens**: The app provides a seamless experience across different Android device screen sizes and orientations.

- **Dark Theme**: Enjoy a dark-themed interface that's easy on the eyes, especially in low-light conditions.

- **Material Design 3**: The app follows the latest Material Design guidelines for a modern and user-friendly UI.

- **Dynamic Colors**: The app dynamically adapts to different color schemes for a personalized experience.

## Architecture
The IMDb-like Android app is built with a robust architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clean code. We've used the MVVM pattern with Clean Architecture:

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Separates the user interface from the business logic and data, making the app easy to test and maintain.

- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to make changes in the future without disrupting the entire app.

## Technologies Used
- **Jetpack Compose**: The latest UI toolkit for Android to create a modern, reactive user interface.

- **Kotlin**: The programming language for Android development, known for its conciseness and safety.

- **TMDb API**: To fetch movie and TV show data.
